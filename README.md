<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

> To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

To run a cloned Create React App project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project using the `cd` command. For example, if the project is located in a folder called "my-app", use:

  ```shell
   cd my-app
  ```
Once you are in the project's directory, install the project dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will fetch and install all the necessary packages and dependencies specified in the project's package.json file.

After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will compile the project and start a local development server. You should see output indicating that the server is running and listening for requests.

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000. You should see your Create React App project running and can interact with it in the browser.

During development, the server will automatically reload the app whenever you make changes to the source code. Simply save your changes, and the browser will update to reflect those changes.

Remember to keep the terminal or command prompt window open while running the development server. You can stop the server at any time by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt.

That's it! You can now explore, modify, and test your cloned Create React App project on your local machine.
